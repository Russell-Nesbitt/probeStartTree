# Vanilla-Like Probe Start Tech Tree Mod
An unmanned start tech tree mod, inspired by theonegalen's "Unkerballed Start" and Yemo's "Unmanned Before Manned" trees.

This mod is intended to provide an unmanned start that would otherwise feel as familiar as possible to the vanilla experience.  

All vanilla tech tree nodes have been retained, though several have been moved into more appropriate places in the tree.  

Progression should be roughly as challenging as the vanilla game, so your preferred difficulty settings should still apply.
Keep in mind that Crew/EVA reports will not be available from the start, so Science income will be slightly lower in the early game.  

 ### Incompatibilies (Subject to Change) ###
This mod is currently incompatible with any mod that changes the tech tree structure in any way, or that modifies any of the same Part config files that this mod edits.
It is also incompatible with any mod that changes the dictionary.cfg file in any way, though this should be resolved at some point.  

It should be fully compatible with any mod that adds new parts to any of the vanilla tech tree nodes, though said nodes may be present at different locations in the tech tree due to progression changes made by this mod. The hidden-in-vanilla "Nanolathing" and "Experimental Motors" nodes have been integrated into the tree for this reason, and are currently empty.    

 ### Installation ###
All official DLC is required for this mod to function.  
Click the green "<> Code" button and select "Download ZIP".  
Extract the zipped file that results.     
In a separate window, navigate to .../steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program  
It is strongly recommended to make a backup copy of the "GameData" folder before you proceed.  
In the unzipped download, navigate into the "probeStartTree-main" folder, and then into the "probeStartTree" folder.
Drag the "GameData" folder found within into .../Kerbal Space Program in the other open window.  
Merge all folders when prompted.  
Overwrite all files when prompted.  
Done!  

 ### Major Changes (Not Exhaustive or Finalized) ###
Begins with the Stayputnik and the Thermometer unlocked, plus the Communotron 16-S and Z-100 Battery Pack for data transmission.  

Better probe cores are unlocked by progressing along the "Stability"->"Flight Control" branch, which continues into the "Unmanned Tech" branch (moved appropriately).  

Post HG-5 communication antennas have all been shifted down a tier respectfully. 

The "Automation" Node is empty and has been retained for compatibility with mods that add tech to that node.  
Similarly, the hidden "Nanolathing" and "Experimental Motors" nodes have been made visible and integrated into the tree.
  
Manned Pods are not unlocked until tier 4, with the "Basic Command Pod" node.  

Manned pod progression begins with the KV-1, and splits into the "Heavy" line, which continues with the KV-series, and the "Advanced" line, which contains the rest. Note that the KV-series pods are accessed a tier before their Advanced equivalent in terms of crew capacity, but do not unlock with large enough parachutes to allow a safe landing.
  
The two branches converge to unlock the MK1-3 and the higher-capacity lander command pods. Therefore, the player can decide which branch they wish to follow.  
  
It is intended that Kerbals EVA out of the KV-series pods in the lower atmosphere (like in the real-world early Vostok missions) and land using their personal parachutes. 
In Career Mode, this requires upgrading the Astronaut Complex, so keep this in mind.    
  
Drogue Parachutes are unlocked through the "Survivability" and "Landing" nodes, with standard parachutes unlocked only through the manned pods branch.  

The "Landing" branch has been shifted up a tier, mostly to open up more internal space in the tech tree.  

The LT-05 Micro Landing Struts have been moved up into "Space Exploration" and unlock alongside the basic Rovemax rover wheels and the Rovemate probe core.  

 ### Uninstallation ###
 If you backed up your "GameData" folder, just delete the GameData folder currently in .../steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program, and replace it with the backed-up copy.  
 If you did not back up your "GameData" folder, you'll have to reinstall all edited KSP files through Steam's "Verify Integrity of Game Files" ability. NOTE THAT THIS WILL RESTORE EVERY EDITED KSP FILE TO ITS VANILLA STATE! BACK UP ANY OTHER INSTALLED KSP MODS FIRST!  

 ### Planned Features ###
Resolve the dependency on the dictionary config file to increase compatibility with other mods.  
Add custom thumbnails for all new tech tree nodes.  
Finalize the basic structure of the tech tree, and adjust part purchase costs if required for balance.  

 ### Long Term Plans  ###
Once the basic structure of the tech tree is finalized, this mod will be split into two (and possibly three) mods.  
All three submods will provide the same modified tech tree.  

The first submod will be installed identically to the current version, via directly overwriting files in the GameData folder. This is intended to be the simplest and easiest way to get started, but is the most difficult to uninstall and would have a high risk of mod incompatibility issues.  

The second submod will be integrated with Module Manager, for compatibility with other mods that might make changes to existing parts or add new nodes to the tech tree.  

The possible third mod will port this tech tree structure into a Community Tech Tree plugin, for maximum compatibility with other tech tree mods. However, the main goal of this mod is to provide an experience very similar to vanilla KSP, which may make a truly successful transition impossible. Furthermore, theonegalen's "Unkerballed Start" mod already does an excellent job of this.
